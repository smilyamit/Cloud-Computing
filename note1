#Cloud computing (for my understanding)
=>Cloud is a set of tools that helps you (as a developer) to spend less time on managing and spend more time on creating

#cloud computing (By standard way)
=>Cloud computing is basically the provision of providing computing resources (e.g. servers, storage, databases, network 
components, software, analysis and intelligent functions) via the Internet, i.e. the cloud
Major clod service provider are (aws, azure, GCP)

#Cloud Terminlology
1 High Avaliablity: (eg google drive)
2 Fault tolerant: (new instance is created at same tilme when running instance failed)
3 Scalability: AS instantaneously no of user increases (eg in evening in netflix) simultaneously no of instance is increased
4 Elasticity: As no of user decreases (eg morining time in netflix) simultaneously no of instance is decreased
 Amazon 
A server can handle only a limited amount of users (normally 1 million for medium server)

EC2= Elastic computer cloud 
S3- simple storage service
VPC- virtual private cloud
RDS- Relational Database Service 
    
vpc- vpc is your private section of aws where you can place your aws resources and allow/restrict others to access to them
     A VPC can be described as your own "private section" of AWS

EC2 = basic computer with internet = EC2 server = EC2 instance (Virtual Computer with Processing power but no storage)
so, EC2 is a virtual computer that u can use for whatever u like

RDS- is aws provisoned database service for organizing user informations)
     (eg user list,user personalised catalogue(for mov), new user adding, old user login, logout)

S3- Amazon S3 is a large datastorage bucket (in petabyte). It is used to store data of customer for permanent usage
   (like netflix stores all videos file there so that it can provide any video to any instance whenever required)
   Generally data storage is not done on ec2 instances because there is always addition or sub of instances


AWS region: aws data center prime location with 1 or more Avalability zone
