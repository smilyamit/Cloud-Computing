#Cloud computing (for my understanding)
=>Cloud is a set of tools that helps you (as a developer) to spend less time on managing and spend more time on creating

#cloud computing (By standard way)
=>Cloud computing is basically the provision of providing computing resources (e.g. servers, storage, databases, network 
components, software, analysis and intelligent functions) via the Internet, i.e. the cloud
Major clod service provider are (aws, azure, GCP)

Amazon
EC2= Elastic computer cloud
S3- simple storage service
VPC- virtual private cloud
RDS- Relational Database Service

vpc- vpc is your private section of aws where you can place your aws resources and allow/restrict others to access to them

EC2 = basic computer with internet = EC2 server = EC2 instance
so, EC2 is a virtual computer that u can use for whatever u like

A server can handle only a limited amount of users (normally 1 million for medium server)
RDS- is aws provisoned database service

#Cloud Terminlology
1 High Avaliablity: (eg google drive)
2 Fault tolerant: (new instance is created at same tilme when running instance failed)
3 Scalability: AS instantaneously no of user increases (eg in evening in netflix) simultaneously no of instance is increased
4 Elasticity: As no of user decreases (eg morining time in netflix) simultaneously no of instance is decreased
